In order to run the game, you need to first download the entire folder in your directory. 
Once you have downloaded it, click on flap.py on your normal python console. 
In order to run the game, we need to have pygame and neat-python installed in our pc.
So, if you don't have it, go the command prompt and type pip install pygame and once it gets
downloaded, type pip install neat-python.
Once both are installed, the game will run in the game console.
PLAY!
